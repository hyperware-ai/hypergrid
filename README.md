# Hyperware Provider Network Monorepo

Projects:
- [Operator](operator/README.md)
- [Hypergrid Provider](hypergrid-provider/README.md) 
- [HPN Shim](hypergrid-shim/README.md)


Follow instructions in their respective README's.


Notes:
HPN Provider currently requires a special branch to be built. For now, `kit update --branch zhr/wit-consolidation` should be used for any development purposes (remember, `kit b --hyperapp`).
